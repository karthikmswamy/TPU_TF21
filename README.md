# Introductory Notebooks for ML on TPU with Colab

1. `Keras MNIST TPU vs GPU vs CPU.ipynb`: compare training on CPU, GPU and TPU 
2. `Keras_MNIST_TPU_using_TensorBoard.ipynb`: connect TensorBoard to the training and view results on Colab
3. `Keras_Flowers_TPU_FineTuning_Save_Restore.ipynb`: Fine-tune from existing TF models, save and restore the trained model to get inference calls
